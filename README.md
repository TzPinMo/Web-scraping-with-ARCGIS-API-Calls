# Web-scraping-with-ARCGIS-API-Calls
How to retrieve biocimate/landform/landcover data from USGS interactive map through API calls:
- World City Name Data Source: https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities
- Interactive Map: https://rmgsc.cr.usgs.gov/ecosystems/dataviewer.shtml
- API Documentation: https://rmgsc.cr.usgs.gov/arcgis/sdk/rest/index.html#//02ss0000006v000000
- The code only scrapes data for 1,000 cities as demonstration.
